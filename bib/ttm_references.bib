  abstract = {The combined decentralisation of many firms and services and the increasing concentration of traditional public transport services in the main corridors of urban centres have made it more difficult for people to access jobs, in particular when residing outside these prime accessibility areas. This is the first national study within the context of Great Britain to examine whether better public transport job accessibility, modelled at the micro level of individuals, improves employment probabilities for people living in Great Britain. While previous studies have typically concentrated on US metropolitan areas, our study uses British national employment micro datasets to assess which urban and rural areas and population groups would benefit from better public transport services. In an important departure from most standard accessibility methodologies, we computed a public transport job accessibility measure applied nationwide and combined this with individual-level employment probability models for Great Britain. The models were corrected for endogeneity by applying an instrumental variable approach. The study finds that better public transport job accessibility improves individual employment probabilities, in particular in metropolitan areas and smaller cities and towns with lower car ownership rates and in low-income neighbourhoods. It further shows that mainly lower educated groups and young people would benefit from better public transport job accessibility. The findings in this study are important for policymakers in that they imply that, in particular, job seekers who rely on public transport services may benefit from more targeted public policies to improve their accessibility to employment and thereby their social mobility.},

Being mobile increasingly involves the production, storage, processing and sharing of data (consciously or not), from car sensor data for diagnostics and insurance apps for driving, to ticketing apps for public transport, urban micromobility share schemes, Google maps, fitness and wellbeing apps, Internet of Things sensors, AI in migration ``management``, or air pollution data. The `datafication' of mobility raises new questions with regards to justice. What kinds of inequalities emerge at the intersection of mobilities and datafication? Whose mobility gets included and excluded through data collection and sharing, why and how? How are mobilities enabled and restricted through data? How are access and ownership to mobility and data changing? What about the mobility of data in relation to justice? This article links scholarship on mobility justice and data justice to develop a mobility data justice framework. It closes with a discussion of critical issues for mobility data justice and develops an agenda for future research in this area. The lens of social justice helps to understand the multiple ways power and (in) equalities are transformed or amplified at the intersection of mobility and data.},

CBA evaluates the effectiveness of such infrastructure, determining whether and to what extent the present benefits overcome the present opportunity costs. However, it fails to include equity issues, which are the key aspects of transport planning. After a general discussion of equity in HSR and its link with the concept of accessibility, this study describes some complementary methods to calculate the variation in equity. Four of them (i.e. the potential accessibility index, spatial rail equity index, Gini index, and coefficient of variation) were adopted to assess the equity impacts for the Italian municipalities along the Turin-Lyon HSR. The results of the analysis reveal that despite a generalised increase in overall accessibility, equity implications are more contradictory, with main localities gaining further benefits compared to medium- and small-sized municipalities. In particular, the latter register a further increase in peripheralization. However, since they account for 36\% of the total surface but represent only approximately 1\% of the total population, the overall balance for the population served by the infrastructure may be considered positive. These results are particularly useful in contexts where the acceptance of HSR is weak, as they allow policymakers to identify adequate compensation measures to reduce the gap and increase territorial cohesion.},

Scientific literature has reported limited contributions regarding the impacts of such infrastructures on the regional systematic mobility and their negative effects on locations excluded from the service. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a method for assessing the implications of regional accessibility on work and study trips, by comparing the two HSR options mentioned above (new segregated or upgraded existing lines). Instead of considering static indicators (e.g., population), the number of train commuters and the variation in travel times for each of the local employment systems crossed by the railway are used as input data. This method is then applied to analyse the territories located along the Venice{\textendash}Trieste line (in the north-eastern part of Italy) that are characterised by several medium-sized municipalities and crossed by two TEN-T lines. An upgrade of the existing line rather than the construction of a segregated HSR is preferable for local commuters in terms of average travel times and social equity, also considering the expected construction costs. These results complement traditional medium- and long-distance market analyses and may be useful for policymakers to define the most appropriate territorial strategies for the development of specific TEN-T stretches.},

Location-based accessibility indicators are promising candidates, but indicator values can vary strongly depending on time of day and transfer wait times. Capturing this variation increases complexity, slowing calculations. This paper presents new methods for rapid yet rigorous computation of accessibility metrics, allowing immediate feedback during early-stage transit planning while being rigorous enough for final analyses. The approach is statistical, characterizing the uncertainty and variability in accessibility metrics related to differences in departure time and headway-based scenario specification. The analysis was carried out on a detailed multimodal network model including both public transportation and streets. Land use data were represented at high resolution. These methods were implemented as open-source software running on a commodity cloud infrastructure. Networks were constructed from standard open data sources, and scenarios were built in a map-based web interface. A case study is presented, describing how these methods were applied in a long-term transportation planning process for an urbanized, polycentric Randstad region in the Netherlands.},

It is difficult to include fares in shortest-path algorithms because fares are often path-dependent. When fare policies allow discounted transfers, for example, the fare for a given journey segment depends on characteristics of previous journey segments. Existing methods to characterize tradeoffs between travel time and monetary cost objectives do not scale well to complex networks, or they rely on approximations. Additionally, they often require assumed values of time, which may be problematic for evaluating the equity of service provision. We propose a new method that allows us to find Pareto sets of paths, jointly minimizing fare and travel time. Using a case study in greater Boston, Massachusetts, USA, we test the algorithm's performance as part of an interactive web application for computing accessibility metrics. Potential extensions for journey planning and route choice models are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Perfect rationality (PR) has been widely used in modeling travel behavior. As opposed to PR, bounded rationality (BR) has recently regained researchers' attention since it was first introduced into transportation science in the 1980s due to its power in more realistic travel behavior modeling and prediction. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the models of BR route choice behavior, aiming to identify current research gaps and provide directions for future research. Despite a small but growing body of studies on employing bounded rationality principle, BR route choice behavior remains understudied due to the following reasons: (a) The existence of BR thresholds leads to mathematically intractable properties of equilibria; (b) BR parameters are usually latent and difficult to identify and estimate; and (c) BR is associated with human being's cognitive process and is challenging to model. Accordingly, we will review how existing literature addresses the aforementioned challenges in substantive and procedural bounded rationality models. Substantive bounded rationality models focus on choice outcomes while procedural bounded rationality models focus on the empirical studies of choice processes. Bounded rationality models in each category can be further divided based on whether time dimension is included. Accordingly, static and dynamic traffic assignment are introduced in substantive bounded rationality while two-stage cognitive models and day-to-day learning models in procedural bounded rationality are discussed. The methodologies employed in substantive bounded rationality include game theory and interactive congestion game, while those in procedural bounded rationality mainly adopt random utility and non- or semi-compensatory models. A comparison of all existing methodologies are given and bounded rationality models' scope and boundaries in terms of predictability, transferability, tractability, and scalability are discussed. Finally existing research gaps are presented and several promising future research directions are given.},

These isochrones can be used to compare the range and area of urban access for each of these modes, over different time limits and for different times of day. Such mapping gears urban morphology to the phenomenology of urban transport and enables us to better understand mode choice. Through design research we can also test a range of possible design scenarios for infrastructure investment and show their impact on the isochrone maps. We conclude with a focus on the relations between car and public transport isochrones as a means of better understanding car-dependency and what we call the `Car/PT assemblage'.},

We show that there are clear inequalities across cohorts in the distribution of benefits that the transit system provides as measured by the number of reachable valued destinations. The results indicate that areas of low accessibility have a higher percentage of African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, low-income workers, low-educated citizens, and the elderly. The most affected cohort are low-income workers, for whom access to jobs, parks, groceries, hospitals, and libraries decline as their number grows. The findings also highlight that inequities are most severe, in order, to jobs, hospitals, and grocery stores when examining the different cohorts.

Accessibility measures are reviewed using a broad range of relevant criteria, including theoretical basis, interpretability and communicability, and data requirements of the measures. Accessibility impacts of land-use and transport strategies are often evaluated using accessibility measures, which researchers and policy makers can easily operationalise and interpret, such as travelling speed, but which generally do not satisfy theoretical criteria. More complex and disaggregated accessibility measures, however, increase complexity and the effort for calculations and the difficulty of interpretation. The current practice can be much improved by operationalising more advanced location-based and utility-based accessibility measures that are still relatively easy to interpret for researchers and policy makers, and can be computed with state-of-the-practice data and/or land-use and transport models. Research directions towards theoretically more advanced accessibility measures point towards the inclusion of individual's spatial-temporal constraints and feedback mechanisms between accessibility, land-use and travel behaviour. Furthermore, there is a need for theoretical and empirical research on relationships between accessibility, option values and non-user benefits, and the measurement of different components of accessibility. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {To capture the complex relationships between transportation and land use, researchers and practitioners are increasingly using placebased measures of transportation accessibility to support a broad range of planning goals. This research reviews the state-of-the-art in applied transportation accessibility measurement and performs a comparative evaluation of software tools for calculating accessibility by walking and public transit including ArcGIS Pro, Emme, R5R, and OpenTripPlanner using R and Python, among others. Using a case study of Toronto, we specify both origin-based and regional-scale analysis scenarios and find significant differences in computation time and calculated accessibilities. While the calculated travel time matrices are highly correlated across tools, each tool produces different results for the same origin-destination pair. Comparisons of the estimated accessibilities also reveal evidence of spatial clustering in the ways paths are calculated by some tools relative to others at different locations around the city. With the growing emphasis on accessibility-based planning, analysts should approach the calculation of accessibility with care and recognize the potential for algorithmic dependence in their calculated accessibility results.},

  abstract = {Conventional integral measures of accessibility, although valuable as indicators of place accessibility, have several limitations when used to evaluate individual accessibility. Two alternatives for overcoming some of the difficulties involved are explored in this study. One is to adapt these measures for evaluating individual accessibility using a disaggregate, nonzonal approach. The other is to develop different types of measures based on an alternative conceptual framework. To pursue the former alternative, this study specifies and examines eighteen gravity-type and cumulative-opportunity accessibility measures using a point-based spatial framework. For the latter option, twelve space-time accessibility measures are developed based on the construct of a prism-constrained feasible opportunity set. This paper compares the relationships and spatial patterns of these thirty measures using network-based GIS procedures. Travel diary data collected in Columbus, Ohio, and a digital data set of 10,727 selected land parcels are used for all computation. Results of this study indicate that space-time and integral indices are distinctive types of accessibility measures which reflect different dimensions of the accessibility experience of individuals. Since space-time measures are more capable of capturing interpersonal differences, especially the effect of space-time constraints, they are more ``gender sensitive'' and helpful for unraveling gender/ethnic differences in accessibility. An important methodological implication is that whether accessibility is observed to be important or different between individuals depends heavily on whether the measure used is capable of revealing the kind of differences the analyst intends to observe.},

Commuting by public transit, in particular, is hypothesized to lead to more overall walking, relative to commuting with a car. A statewide computer assisted telephone survey in New Jersey (n=530) was used to collect information on the mode usually used for the commute, the frequency of walking for all purposes, socio-demographic characteristics and neighborhood indicators of the presence of destinations within a 10min walk. Ordered probit models of the frequency of walk trips were estimated. Respectively, 63\% and 68\%, of those commuting by transit and walking or bicycling report walking at least once a day. Public transit commuters walked more frequently for all purposes than car commuters; and almost as frequently as those walking to work. There were significant differences in walking frequency between transit modes (bus vs. train/subway/light rail) and non-significant differences between transit access mode (walking vs. park-and-ride). Working from home was not associated with more frequent walking. The time that a transit user spent walking to transit stations or stops was on average slightly shorter than the time spent walking during a journey to work by walking. Walking more to access neighborhood destinations seemed to account for this higher frequency of walking in transit users. Transit service and neighborhood destinations may be complementary in supporting increased walking activity and transit use.},

This chapter adds to this body of literature by presenting an accessibility index that can be easily used to assess and rank metropolitan regions based on the overall level of equity of a region's transport system. In the chapter, we discuss the rationale of the index, discuss its properties, and apply it to the Rotterdam-The Hague metropolitan area in the Netherlands. We start with the definition of accessibility poverty, which refers to a situation of low accessibility that severely restricts a person's ability to participate in the activities deemed normal in a particular society. Drawing on the indices to measure income poverty, we define an accessibility poverty risk index, which takes into account both the intensity of accessibility poverty (How low is the accessibility level experienced by people?) and the extent of accessibility poverty (How many people are affected by accessibility poverty?). The application to the Rotterdam-The Hague region shows, perhaps against expectations, that (sub)urban areas contribute most to the overall accessibility poverty risk in the region. We end with a discussion on how the accessibility poverty risk index can be employed in the practice of transport planning and project appraisal.},

A number of different measures of accessibility, defined as the potential to reach spatially dispersed opportunities, have been proposed in the literature, and used to address various substantive planning and policy questions. Our objective in this paper is to conduct a review of various commonly used measures of accessibility, with a particular view to clarifying their normative (i.e. prescriptive), as well as positive (i.e. descriptive) aspects. This is a distinction that has seldom been made in the literature and that helps to better understand the meaning of alternative ways to implement the concept of accessibility. Our discussion of the positive and normative aspects of accessibility measurements is illustrated using the city of Montreal, Canada, as a case study. The example highlights the differences in the measured levels of accessibility depending on implementation. Comparison of the two by means of a relative indicator of accessibility helps to identify the gap between desired (as normative defined) and actual (as revealed) accessibility levels. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

A cohort of everyday cyclists was supplied with a global positioning system device and a heart rate monitor and asked to collect data from their journeys in Leeds, UK. The analysis determines the cyclists' speeds and accelerations at every point on their journey and elevation data, corroborated by mapping information, was used to determine the gradient. Two linear regression models of speed and acceleration were estimated and show that the influence of a downhill gradient on speed is less pronounced than the effect of an uphill gradient. The results indicate an eighty-fifth percentile speed on the flat of 22kph, and for a downhill gradient of 3\%, 25kph. The power required to cycle has been estimated and shows that cyclists deliver around 150W on the flat, but that this rises to around 250W climbing hills. Mean acceleration on the flat is 0.231m/s2 and the average power output over the acceleration phase, which is of mean duration 26s, is approximately 120W. Air resistance accounts for approximately 70\% of the resistive force when cycling at design speed. It is recommended that designers adopt 25kph as a design speed for gradients less than 3\%, but that consideration should be given to design speeds of up to 35kph for steeper gradients. Free-flow speeds in this range should be used when modelling mode and route choices and in benefit appraisal.},

The elderly had the most inequitable distribution of population relative to other cohorts. Perth's population exhibits a 0.52 Gini coefficient suggesting a relatively unequal spatial distribution of services to the population. However, this is much better than Melbourne (at 0.68). Results imply that 70\% of Perth's population have only 33\% of services supplied, whilst in Melbourne this figure was 19\%.

Use of public transport generally involves some walking to bus stops or train stations. This paper is a systematic review of how much time is spent in physical activity among adults using public transport. It also explores the potential effect on the population level of physical activity if inactive adults in NSW, Australia, increased their walking through increased use of public transport. Of 1,733 articles, 27 met the search criteria, and nine reported on absolute measures of physical activity associated with public transport. A further 18 papers reported on factors associated with physical activity as part of public transport use. A range of 8{\textendash}33 additional minutes of walking was identified from this systematic search as being attributable to public transport use. Using ``bootstrapping'' statistical modelling, if 20\% of all inactive adults increased their walking by only 16 minutes a day for five days a week, we predict there would be a substantial 6.97\% increase in the proportion of the adult population considered ``sufficiently active''. More minutes walked per day, or a greater uptake of public transport by inactive adults would likely lead to significantly greater increases in the adult population considered sufficiently active.},

  abstract = {A shift from private motorised transport to more active transportation can, among other things, deliver significant health benefits. The main disadvantage of active transport (in particular walking) for most people compared to private motorised transport is the limited range. Public transport (PT) can complement the use of active modes and extend their range. Therefore, there might be potential to increase physical activity through an increase in PT use. This article takes a closer look at how walking relates to the use of PT by examining existing literature on the topic. It aims to study how far people walk to and from PT and what key factors influence this. Scopus, Transport Research International Documentation and Web of Science have been searched systematically for relevant articles, conference papers and books. After screening of titles and abstracts, 41 relevant publications were identified. Studies were included if they quantified the amount of walking (measured as either distance or time) that is directly related to the use of PT. Studies that quantified walking using general measures of daily physical activity or daily walking or that used stated preference designs were excluded. The PT systems considered in this paper are mass transport systems in urban areas, either road- or rail-based, with fixed schedules and stops. Demand responsive transport services, which can offer door-to-door travel, are not considered, as these systems can to a large extent eliminate the need to walk. In the identified publications, a large variety of walking distances and times have been reported, and these seem to be highly context-specific. The paper establishes the evidence for the wide range of factors that influence walking related to PT, which have been categorised as personal, PT-related, environmental, and journey-related. The different methods that have been used are discussed by critically analysing their advantages and limitations. Only a limited number of these methods used allow for an accurate assessment of the walking distances to and from PT. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research, such as a need for more accurate measurement of walking and research in different geographical areas to shed light on underlying influences of culture and climate.},

  abstract = {Understanding how access to public transport varies across space is important in a wide variety of urban research. For instance, how is access related to risks of unemployment? How does access to urban amenities capitalise into land prices? Does good accessibility drive gentrification? Much research has focused on distance-based measures because they are straightforward to derive. However, they often assume access to a car since mobility is seen as being equally possible in all directions. This is not a justifiable assumption in many cases, particularly for lower income groups in urban areas. It would therefore be useful to have accessibility measures which assume travel by public transport. The present work addresses this unmet need. It offers a series of accessibility indicators at the level of the Lower Super Output Area/Datazone (LSOA/DZ) covering the whole of Great Britain (GB) in the United Kingdom (UK). Indicators by public transport include a range of key amenities and services such as: employment; general practice (GP) surgery; hospital; grocery store; supermarket; primary school; secondary school; and urban centre.

  abstract = {Public transport accessibility to urban and regional services has been found to relate to various social and economic processes, such as unemployment, transport mode choice, property prices, and public health. A frequent type of measures representing accessibility are location-based. While these offer advantages, like flexibility and ease of interpretation, their estimation usually requires specialized skills and substantial computational resources. To lower these barriers, we have prepared a suite of accessibility indicators for key services across Great Britain at a spatially disaggregated level. The dataset includes ready-to-use public transport accessibility indicators for employment, general practitioners (GP, or family physician), hospitals, grocery stores, supermarkets, primary and secondary schools, and urban centres. It also includes the raw travel time matrix from each origin to every potential destination, a primary input for such indicator estimation. Altogether, this resource offers various levels of application, from direct input into a range of research topics to the foundation for creating comprehensive custom indicators.},

  abstract = {With the rapid urban development, efficiency and social equity in traffic planning have raised increasing attention among scholars in different fields. Existing research have been conducted from a single perspective, while the integrated theoretical framework for quantifying the relationship between equity and service effec\- tiveness (SEV) of public transport has rarely been established. In this study, the Chinese metropolis-Shanghai, was used as an example to explore the relationship between the equity and SEV of public transport from the supply and demand perspective. The research methodology incorporated the use of the Lorenz curve, Gini co\- efficient, Gap analysis, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model, and spatial overlay analysis. The discovery is that most of the undersupply, supply-demand matching, and ineffectiveness areas were found in Shanghai's inner and outer suburbs. Public transport in the inner core and border areas was generally characterized by oversupply and a mixture of high and ineffectiveness. Overall, it is challenging to balance equity and SEV. This study can aid policy makers in achieving a balance between SEV and equity in transit planning, to improve transport SEV, and to promote a greater equity of transport opportunities among disadvantaged groups.},

A large number of methodological and policy relevant results emerge, some of which challenge established conventions, and the implications for value of time recommendations, policy and further research are spelt out.},

However, the amenity effects of urban facilities have not been fully assessed, and their spatial heterogeneity has largely been neglected. Taking Nanjing as an example, this study adopts a synthetic approach that considers scarcity, accessibility, and submarkets, and highlights the influence of the idiosyncratic characteristics of urban facilities and heterogeneous urban spaces on housing prices. We divide urban facilities into two categories based on scarcity: irreplaceable and replaceable facilities. We find that the influence of urban facilities differs among different categories and submarkets, and the influence of irreplaceable facilities is highly dependent on accessibility in all submarkets, while that of replaceable facilities relies on both the accessibility and scarcity of those facilities. This study contributes to our understanding of the importance of and differences among the effects of various public facilities on property values in the intra-urban environment.},
